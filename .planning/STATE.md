# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-10-13, after v1.0 milestone)

**Core value:** Each player can see, through their stat cards, exactly where they stand compared to players of the same class and function — and what they must improve to reach guild standards.
**Current focus:** Phase 07 — Dummy-Data Seed & Catalog Alignment

## Current Position

Phase: 07 (Dummy-Data Seed & Catalog Alignment) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 4
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-10-14

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full decision log lives in PROJECT.md Key Decisions and the archived phase documents (`.planning/milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md`, phase SUMMARY/VERIFICATION files kept in `.planning/phases/`).

- [Phase 07]: Hunter line catalog entry = Sniper (not Ranger): live-API verification 2026-10-13 confirmed the Archer line's released top job is Sniper (second_advanced_transfer); Ranger is third_transfer/unreleased, same rule as Grand Summoner/Nightwatch. Surfaced at the D-12 review gate.
- [Phase 07]: Migration 0012 ships catalog alignment (11 renames, guarded Dancer/Super Novice removals, Summoner/Rebellion additions) + char_function CHECK widen (tank->suporte, mdps added) in one append-only corrective migration. Local rehearsal ran against real Postgres 18.4 via embedded binaries (no supabase CLI/Docker in this environment); live key-stat count parity re-check owned by 07-04.

### Blockers/Concerns (open — carry to next milestone)

- **[Operational] Do NOT revoke JWT signing key 6f7657c3** (standby) — revoking it kills every member session instantly
- **[Pre-launch] Owner must rotate the Supabase access token** used for deploys, and rotate placeholder whitelist rows/PINs before inviting real members (credentials/hashes recoverable from git history, WR-06; standing action since 03-02)
- **[Pre-launch] Owner must replace `public/examples/*.svg`** placeholder example shots with real game screenshots before inviting real members (acknowledged 02-03 UAT step 8)
- **[Pending live op] Catalog re-seed of the 6 reclassified flat damage stats** (pve_dmg_bonus, pvp_dmg_bonus, mdmg_bonus, pdmg_bonus, pve_dmg_reduction, pvp_dmg_reduction → 'flat', D-05-UAT-10) via apply-seed.mjs was auth-gated and never run — live catalog still shows the superseded value_type for those six
- **[OCR calibration] Structural reader thresholds need production-data calibration** — spike GO was 100.0% on 11 owner-device samples but device fragmentation is not covered; after a game-UI change, recalibrate the visual grammar in structure.ts (GAME_LABELS, SCREENS row order, probe thresholds) and re-run the harness grid — never pixel fractions

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and deferred at milestone close on 2026-10-13:

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| todo | power-shift-significance | pending — v2 domain (delta badges / submission history); owner wants combat_power shifts flagged as significant only at thousands scale between submissions |
| uat | 05-UAT.md / 06-UAT.md "unknown" audit flags | false positive — both files carry `status: complete` with owner verbatim approvals recorded; parser artifact, no action needed |

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-10-14T04:38:36.083Z
Stopped at: Completed 07-01-PLAN.md (catalog alignment migration 0012 + classes.sql rewrite; rehearsed locally on real Postgres)
Resume file: .planning/phases/07-dummy-data-seed-catalog-alignment/07-01-SUMMARY.md

## Performance Metrics

| Phase | Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files | Completed |
|-------|------|----------|-------|-------|-----------|
| 07 | 07-01 | ~62 min | 2 | 2 | 2026-10-14 |
